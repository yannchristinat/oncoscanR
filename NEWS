### What's new in v1.0
- The nLST test has been clinically validated on 384 patients from the PAOLA-1
trial and the recommended threshold
is now >=15.
- The default value for arm-level alterations has been set to 90% as mentioned
in the publication [Christinat et al., J Mol Diagn 2021; PMID: 34454110].
- The genomic LOH score (percent of LOH bases) has been added; `score_gloh`.
- Adds a flag "low tumor?" if the percentage of altered bases is less than 1%.
- Package to be released on Bioconductor

### What's new in v0.2
- Novel HRD score (nLST: number of LSTs, normalized by ploidy): `score_nlst`
- Change in Oncoscan workflow to use the nLST score and thresholds.
- New function to compute the number of Mb altered (with or without LOH):
`score_mbalt`
- New function to compute the average copy number: `score_avgcn`
- New function to estimate the number of whole-genome duplication events (based
on the average copy number and the thresholds defined by Carter et al.): `score_estwgd`
