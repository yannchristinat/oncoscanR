Description: The software uses the copy number segments from a text file and 
    identifies all chromosome arms that are globally altered and computes various 
    genome-wide scores. The following HRD scores (characteristic of BRCA-mutated cancers) 
    are included: LST, HR-LOH, nLST and gLOH. the package is made for the 
    ThermoFisher Oncoscan assay analyzed with their Chromosome Alteration Suite 
    (ChAS) but can be adapted to any input.
